# PDFtoFolder

This Program was created for a menial task that I had to do at an internship. Wewere tasked with turning all the old donor files (this was a non-profit) that dated back before 2000 into digital versions in order to clear up space. The people in charge had a specific way they wanted them stored. Every pdf (which was individually scanned and emailed to a central email), was to be named and then put into a folder with the same name. It was taking a lot fo time to download file, rename, create a new folder, rename and put the file in. Granted one took about 20 seconds, but there were 1,000's of files. Thats where this program came in. It halved the time it took to do the entire process since makeing a folder and namig it correctly took about half the time.
